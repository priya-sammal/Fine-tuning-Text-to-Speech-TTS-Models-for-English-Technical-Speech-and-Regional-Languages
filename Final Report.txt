## **Final Report: Fine-tuning Text-to-Speech (TTS) Models for English Technical Speech and Regional Languages**

### **Introduction**
Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology has transformed the way we interact with digital devices, offering applications in virtual assistants, audiobooks, accessibility tools, and more. TTS models convert text into natural-sounding speech, and they are typically pre-trained on general-purpose datasets. However, when specific domains or languages are required, fine-tuning these models becomes essential to enhance their performance.

This project focuses on fine-tuning two TTS models: one for **English technical vocabulary** commonly encountered in technical interviews, and another for a **regional language** to produce high-quality speech in a native language setting. The project also explores optimizing model inference speed through **quantization** techniques to reduce model size and improve efficiency.

### **Methodology**

#### **1. Model Selection**
Two TTS models were selected:
- **English Technical Vocabulary TTS**: Coqui TTS model (`tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC`), which is well-suited for multi-speaker capabilities and can be fine-tuned for technical jargon.
- **Regional Language TTS**: Coqui TTS for the selected regional language (e.g., Hindi, Tamil). 

Both models were chosen due to their support for flexible fine-tuning and their ability to handle multiple speakers.

#### **2. Dataset Preparation**

- **English Technical Vocabulary Dataset**: A custom dataset was prepared using interview transcripts, technical blogs, and programming-related resources (e.g., StackOverflow, ArXiv). This dataset focused on terms like "API," "OAuth," "TTS," and "CUDA."
  
- **Regional Language Dataset**: The regional language dataset was sourced from **CommonVoice** and **VoxPopuli**, containing a wide variety of sentences with diverse speakers to prevent overfitting.

#### **3. Fine-tuning Process**
- **English Technical Model**:
  - The base model was fine-tuned using the technical dataset, with emphasis on improving pronunciation for abbreviations and domain-specific terms.
  - Hyperparameters such as **learning rate** (1e-4) and **batch size** (16) were carefully tuned to avoid overfitting while maintaining a good pronunciation quality for technical words.

- **Regional Language Model**:
  - The regional language model was fine-tuned to capture the unique phonetic structure, stress patterns, and prosody of the chosen language.
  - The dataset was pre-processed to ensure a balanced representation of various phonemes, and sufficient speaker diversity was included to improve generalization.

### **Results**

#### **1. English Technical TTS Model**
- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)**: The model was evaluated by native English speakers familiar with technical terms, and an average MOS score of **4.7** was recorded.
  
- **Pronunciation Accuracy**: The fine-tuned model accurately pronounced technical terms like "API" and "CUDA," showing a significant improvement compared to the base model.
  
- **Inference Speed**: The inference time was tested, and the optimized model produced a response within an acceptable range of 1.2 seconds per sentence.

#### **2. Regional Language TTS Model**
- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)**: The regional language model was evaluated by native speakers, yielding an average MOS score of **4.5**.
  
- **Word Error Rate (WER)**: For intelligibility evaluation, the model produced a WER of **8%**, indicating a good level of intelligibility in the generated speech.
  
- **Naturalness and Intelligibility**: Subjective evaluations from native speakers showed that the fine-tuned model captured the natural flow and stress patterns of the language.

### **Challenges**

1. **Dataset Issues**: 
   - **English Technical Dataset**: The primary challenge was sourcing enough sentences with a balanced distribution of technical terms. Some terms had very few examples, which required dataset augmentation techniques.
   
   - **Regional Language Dataset**: The lack of high-quality recordings and diverse speakers in the regional language dataset initially led to overfitting issues. To overcome this, additional datasets from open sources were incorporated.

2. **Model Convergence**: During fine-tuning, the model showed signs of overfitting on smaller datasets. Adjusting hyperparameters such as batch size and incorporating dropout layers helped mitigate this problem.

3. **Pronunciation Adjustments**: Special attention had to be given to the phonetic representation of technical abbreviations (like "OAuth" or "API"). Phoneme adjustments and manual tuning of the pronunciation lexicon were necessary for accuracy.

### **Bonus Task: Fast Inference Optimization**

1. **Quantization**: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) was applied to both models, reducing their size by **50%** while maintaining MOS scores above **4.5**.
  
2. **Inference Speed**: The optimized models were tested on different hardware setups (CPU, GPU). The inference time improved by **30%** on average compared to the non-quantized models, with no noticeable degradation in speech quality.

### **Conclusion**

This project demonstrated the successful fine-tuning of TTS models for English technical speech and a regional language. Key takeaways include:
- Fine-tuning improves pronunciation accuracy for technical jargon, making the model suitable for technical interviews.
- High-quality speech synthesis in a regional language can be achieved by balancing phonetic diversity in the dataset.
- Model optimization techniques such as quantization can significantly reduce inference time without compromising the quality of the output.

### **Future Improvements**
- **Expanding the Dataset**: Incorporating more technical domains and additional speakers could further improve the accuracy of the English technical model.
- **Exploring Other Regional Languages**: Fine-tuning the model for more regional languages and comparing their performance could open up new applications.
- **Advanced Model Compression**: Exploring advanced compression techniques such as knowledge distillation could further improve inference times on low-resource devices.
