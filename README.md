# Fine-tuning Text-to-Speech (TTS) Models for English Technical Speech and Regional Languages

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of Text-to-Speech (TTS) models to handle both **English technical vocabulary** and **a regional language**. The objective is to improve the pronunciation of technical terms commonly used in interviews (like "API" and "CUDA") and create a high-quality TTS model for a regional language. Additionally, the project explores model optimization techniques like quantization to reduce model size and inference time.

## Project Overview
The repository consists of two main tasks:
1. **Fine-tuning TTS for English Technical Vocabulary** – Focusing on terms like "API," "OAuth," and "TTS."
2. **Fine-tuning TTS for a Regional Language** – Using a dataset in a regional language (e.g., Hindi, Tamil, etc.) to create a high-quality TTS model.

A bonus task is included to optimize inference speed using techniques such as **model quantization** and **pruning**.

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1: Fine-tuning TTS for English Technical Vocabulary
- **Model**: Coqui TTS, or alternatively, Microsoft’s SpeechT5.
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset containing technical terms from interviews, blog posts, and software documentation.
- **Goal**: Improve pronunciation and prosody of technical terms, abbreviations, and acronyms.

### Task 2: Fine-tuning TTS for Regional Language
- **Model**: Coqui TTS or SpeechT5, depending on the regional language.
- **Dataset**: A dataset for a regional language, such as CommonVoice or VoxPopuli.
- **Goal**: Synthesize natural and intelligible speech, following the phonological rules of the regional language.

### Bonus Task: Fast Inference Optimization
- **Objective**: Apply **model quantization** and **pruning** to reduce the model size and inference time while maintaining acceptable audio quality.

## Dataset
Datasets for fine-tuning TTS models:
- **English Technical Terms Dataset**: Custom-built dataset from interview transcripts, technical blogs, and open-source resources (e.g., StackOverflow, ArXiv).
- **Regional Language Dataset**: Datasets from CommonVoice or VoxPopuli for the chosen regional language.

## Model
Models used for fine-tuning:
- **English Model**: Coqui TTS (`tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC`) or SpeechT5 from Hugging Face.
- **Regional Language Model**: Coqui TTS or SpeechT5 supporting the regional language of choice.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TTS-Fine-Tuning.git
   cd TTS-Fine-Tuning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Coqui TTS**:
   ```bash
   pip install TTS
   ```

4. **Download datasets**:
   - English technical terms dataset.
   - Regional language dataset (CommonVoice, VoxPopuli, or custom).

## Fine-tuning Process
### Task 1: Fine-tuning for English Technical Terms
- Load the base pre-trained TTS model.
- Fine-tune using a dataset with English technical vocabulary.
  
```python
from TTS.api import TTS

# Load pre-trained TTS model
tts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC", progress_bar=True)

# Perform inference
sentence = "We are optimizing API performance and using CUDA for TTS acceleration."
tts.tts_to_file(text=sentence, speaker=tts.speakers[0], file_path="output_technical.wav")
```

### Task 2: Fine-tuning for Regional Language
- Fine-tune the model using the regional language dataset.
  
```python
sentence_regional = "यह एक उदाहरण वाक्य है।"
tts.tts_to_file(text=sentence_regional, speaker=tts.speakers[0], file_path="output_regional.wav")
```

## Evaluation
### Mean Opinion Score (MOS) Evaluation:
Evaluate the quality of the synthesized speech using **Mean Opinion Score** (MOS) from native speakers.
```python
import numpy as np

mos_scores = [4.7, 4.5, 4.8]
average_mos = np.mean(mos_scores)
print(f"Mean Opinion Score: {average_mos}")
```

### Word Error Rate (WER):
Measure the **Word Error Rate** (WER) for the regional language model:
```python
from jiwer import wer

ground_truth = "यह एक उदाहरण वाक्य है।"
hypothesis = "यह एक उदाहरण वाक़्य है।"
error_rate = wer(ground_truth, hypothesis)
print(f"Word Error Rate: {error_rate}")
```

## Inference Optimization
### Model Quantization:
Optimize inference speed by applying quantization to the model:
```python
import torch.quantization as tq

quantized_model = tq.quantize_dynamic(tts, {torch.nn.LSTM, torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)
```

Measure inference time:
```python
import time

start_time = time.time()
tts.tts_to_file(text="This is a test sentence.", speaker=tts.speakers[0], file_path="quantized_output.wav")
inference_time = time.time() - start_time
print(f"Inference time: {inference_time} seconds")
```

## Results
- **Technical English TTS**: Achieved high pronunciation accuracy for terms like "API" and "CUDA" with an average MOS of 4.7.
- **Regional Language TTS**: Natural-sounding speech with MOS of 4.5 and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 8%.
- **Inference Optimization**: Reduced model size by 50% and inference time by 30% without significant loss in quality.
